Registration Fee : Team - Rs.200(Max 4/team)<br>
<br>Description<br>
Machine learning hackathon event with diverse problem statements for teams to choose from, encouraging innovation and impact. Finalists will present their projects on the event day and be evaluated based on creativity, feasibility, and impact.
Participants are required to select one of the three domains and develop innovative ML solutions to address specific challenges in their chosen domain.

<br>The three domains are:<br>
>Personalized Learning<br>
>Smart City<br>
>Healthcare<br>
For the Personalized Learning domain, participants will develop ML solutions that can analyze data from various sources to tailor learning content and teaching methods to individual students' needs, preferences, and abilities. Personalized learning can help students achieve better academic outcomes and engagement.
For the Smart City domain, participants will focus on using machine learning to optimize urban services and make cities more efficient, sustainable, and livable. This involves developing algorithms that can analyze data from various sources such as transportation, energy consumption, waste management, and public safety to improve these services.
In the Healthcare domain, participants will work on developing algorithms that can analyze medical data to improve diagnosis, prediction, treatment, and drug discovery. Machine learning can help healthcare providers personalize treatment plans and make more informed decisions, leading to better patient outcomes.

Rules<br>
Team Size : 4 members<br>
Proposal submission deadline: 03/04/2023<br>
Proposal evaluation criteria: Creativity, feasibility, relevance to the problem statement<br>
Presentation and evaluation: On the day of the hackathon, teams will present their projects to judges and participants. Evaluation criteria include originality, creativity, feasibility, technical implementation, and impact. Judges will provide feedback and select winners based on scores.<br>
